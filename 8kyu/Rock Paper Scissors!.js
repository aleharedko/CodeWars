// Rules of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game are:
//
//     Rock beats Scissors,
//     Scissors beat Paper,
//     Paper beats Rock,
//     Two identical moves are a draw.
//     Let's play! You will be given valid moves of two Rock, Paper, Scissors players, and have to return which player won: "Player 1 won!" for player 1, and "Player 2 won!" for player 2. In case of a draw return Draw!.
//
// Examples:
//     "scissors",     "paper"     --> "Player 1 won!"
// "scissors",     "rock"      --> "Player 2 won!"
// "paper",        "paper"     --> "Draw!"


//solution
const rps = (p1, p2) => {
    const rock = 0
    const paper = 1
    const scissors = 2

    if(p1 === p2){
        return ("Draw!")
    } else if((p1 === "scissors" && p2 === "paper") || (p1 === "rock" && p2 === "scissors") || (p1 === "paper" && p2 === "rock")){
        return  "Player 1 won!"
    } else{
        return "Player 2 won!"
    }
